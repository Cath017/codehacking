1
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:02,392
My name is Danny McNamara.

2
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:04,519
When I left the FBI,
I thought my crime-fighting

3
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:06,666
days were over, but then
I learned that terrorist

4
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,550
Karim Farouk was on
the hunt for Cleopatra,

5
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:10,624
one of the world's most
valuable treasures,

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,464
lost for over 2,000 years,

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,591
to use her as part of a
massive terror attack.

8
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,425
To find him, I needed some help,

9
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,932
so I went to Lexi Vaziri, a thief.

10
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:21,359
Excuse me, a master thief.

11
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,409
And my father was killed by Farouk.

12
00:00:23,477 --> 00:00:26,045
Lexi and I have a complicated past.

13
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:29,566
He wants to bring Farouk
to justice, I want revenge.

14
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:31,646
Also, there's a mysterious group

15
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:33,253
who want Cleopatra as much as we do.

16
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:35,699
We're not sure whether
they're good or bad,

17
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,552
but the one thing we all agree on...

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,392
Is that we need to find Cleopatra...

19
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:43,062
Before Farouk does.

20
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,411
Previously on Blood & Treasure...

21
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:47,695
Fabi...

22
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:49,636
You're not lurking
down here in a ski mask

23
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:51,337
working for the Carabinieri.

24
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,840
You're in the Brotherhood of Serapis.

25
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:57,210
We will hunt down Farouk
and we kill him, and you, Lexi,

26
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,336
- can be a part of it.
- I can't do this

27
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,776
without Danny, and he's
definitely gonna want

28
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:03,917
to know who we're working for and why.

29
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:06,425
And if you tell him,
you will both be dead.

30
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:08,688
Welcome to La Casa de Chuck.

31
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:11,658
Maybe it's not such a good idea
if you guys both stay here.

32
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,760
A man named Carlo Velardi runs

33
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,434
the black market bazaar in Rome.

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,107
Don't become my problem.

35
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,660
I wouldn't have minded a heads-up

36
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,322
that we were meeting with the Mafia.

37
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:22,461
The mole in Egyptian intelligence?

38
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,546
Sharif Ghazal.

39
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:26,839
Ghazal has a file in his
safe with Farouk's network.

40
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,902
I found a letter from
Farouk to my father.

41
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:32,040
It implies my dad helped fund

42
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,680
his terror operation.

43
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:36,950
I'm going to receive
the only existing copy

44
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:38,680
of the track logs from the Sauber Depot

45
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,525
dating back all the way
to the Allied bombings.

46
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,931
Now, you said the sarcophagus

47
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,437
was taken by train from there.

48
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:45,711
This could be the key
to finding Cleopatra.

49
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,925
_

50
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,643
Our mission to bring Cleopatra

51
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,806
to the Fatherland is doomed.

52
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:01,669
We need to cut our losses now.

53
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:04,444
Colonel Steiner is dead.

54
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,307
We need to get rid of that coffin.

55
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:07,914
We cannot doubt the mission.

56
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:10,542
The Egyptian queen is our weapon.

57
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,151
She's cursed.

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,149
Let's sell her and get
the hell out of Europe.

59
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,458
I am your superior officer.

60
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,327
Our orders are to deliver
Cleopatra to the U-boat

61
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,263
at the port of Huelva.

62
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,664
We either die with the
mummy or live without her.

63
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:32,805
We swore to protect her.

64
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:35,608
Even against your brothers?

67
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,820
When did you become a vampire?

68
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,479
Sorry, did I wake you?

69
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:23,785
Nah, nah.

70
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,186
I always like to squeeze in a couple

71
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,126
of confessions before morning mass.

72
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,328
Who goes to confession at dawn?

73
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,030
Old ladies.

74
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,265
They travel in packs.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,775
Those papers for your scrapbook?

76
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:38,304
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:40,156
It's all lies.

78
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,642
The convoy was hit by Farouk

79
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:44,576
after the handover ceremony.

80
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,481
He killed the security
team, took the relics.

81
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:51,392
Probably selling them as we speak.

82
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,652
Killed another two people
to get the transit logs

83
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:55,459
from Castle Schädelberg

84
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,189
of where the Nazis took Cleopatra.

85
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,930
Now he's flush with cash
and has the inside track

86
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,737
on completing whatever his plan is.

87
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,129
Somebody's got to stop guys like Farouk.

88
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:05,769
That's what you're doing.

89
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:09,702
Which is why I'm letting
you stay here rent-free.

90
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:12,590
Everything balances out.

91
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,910
You have got to start kicking in
for groceries, though.

92
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,412
Lexi has massacred my fridge.

93
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,482
Also, why is she getting
shady packages delivered here?

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,218
Yeah, uh, well, since you
won't let her stay here,

95
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,983
her living situation's been in flux.

96
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,696
What does that even mean?

97
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,028
Lexi?

98
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:38,963
Erica.

99
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,126
Hello.

100
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,647
You break into my place, eat my food,

101
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:45,335
sleep on my couch, and you're
the one pulling a knife.

102
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,058
Ah, come on. I thought you were out.

103
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:49,341
And that makes it cool that
you're breaking and entering.

104
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,650
I didn't break anything.

105
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,306
It's just more like
entering and napping.

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,381
I have a tiny favor to ask.

107
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,849
Of course you do.

108
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,551
This is a letter...

109
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:01,954
To my dad... from Karim Farouk.

110
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,413
Didn't your dad work with
the FBI to catch him?

111
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,920
This was dated a year before that.

112
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,254
From the part I can make out,

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,428
it sort of implies that they had

114
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,502
a long and fruitful relationship.

115
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:15,495
Let me guess, you want me to clean it up

116
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,331
so you can read the
rest of what it says.

117
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:20,139
Well, you are the best
art restorer in the world.

118
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,244
And between you crashing on my couch

119
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,901
and being overly complimentary,

120
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,827
I assume you have no money.

121
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,434
I count my wealth in
the friendships I have.

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,511
No, I can't pay you.

123
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,873
I need to know, Erica...

124
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,975
If my dad was working with a terrorist.

125
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,661
You've thrown a lot of business my way,

126
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,419
so I'll give this one
to you on the house.

127
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,493
But it's gonna take some time.

128
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:49,168
Time you will spend
sleeping somewhere else.

129
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:50,836
Understood.

130
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:52,004
Thanks.

131
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:58,644
Keep digging.

132
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,846
The train can't be much deeper.

133
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:07,953
Señor Omar, over here!

134
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,344
Is it Cleopatra? Is it?

135
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:22,159
These are Moroccan uniforms.

136
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,385
I want the train! I want Cleopatra!

137
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:28,293
Farouk is not a patient man...

138
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,509
And neither am I.

139
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:35,514
Where are the Nazis?

140
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:56,669
Keep digging.

141
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:08,580
Where are you going?

142
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,982
We're not done yet.

143
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,985
Oh, yes, everybody's done.

144
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:20,759
Do you know who I am?

145
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,729
I think the ignorance is mutual.

146
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:25,931
I am Carlo Velardi.

147
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,167
My family has controlled
the blood antiquities trade

148
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:29,563
in Europe for generations.

149
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,236
No one even rents a shovel

150
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,462
in this part of the world
without paying us protection.

151
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,402
My son, he's a...

152
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,877
Come si dice, a young hothead.

153
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:42,214
I, however, understand
this is just business.

154
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:43,582
Simple choice.

155
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,286
You pay what you owe
and your dig proceeds.

156
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:49,354
And if I don't?

157
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,189
Then you discover that my
men have surrounded you.

158
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:59,131
And we water the ground
with each other's blood.

159
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,539
I'll see that you have your
money first thing tomorrow.

160
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,141
A presto, amico.

161
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,607

162
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,496
_

163
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,769
_

164
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,269
Any luck?

165
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,823
I make my own luck, Danny.

166
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,081
Oh, so you found something.

167
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,140
No.

168
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,513
What are you guys talking about?

169
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,520
She's trying to find a place to crash.

170
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,060
Just for a few nights, I...

171
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:49,782
I'm a really considerate roommate.

172
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,290
So she can laugh.

173
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,131
Good to know.

174
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,178
Any progress on following
the money to Farouk

175
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,864
by tracking who the Egyptian
artifacts were sold to?

176
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,027
How many people in
the world do you think

177
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,834
have the lack of scruples,

178
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,411
cash on hand,

179
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,399
and love of Egyptian antiquities

180
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,106
to buy them from a known terrorist?

181
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:12,304
Can't be this guy because
he's under indictment.

182
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:14,773
And this one's going
through a messy divorce

183
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,508
and isn't flush with cash.

184
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:19,263
Now, I'm working on tracking
down these two guys.

185
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,009
What?

186
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,320
Is that Serbian?

187
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,049
Yeah, I think so.

188
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:33,450
My Serbian isn't great,
but she's saying something

189
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:37,179
about "him getting a win"
while "she takes a hit."

190
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:39,359
Hopefully that isn't an assassination

191
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,766
being planned on my phone.

192
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,397
Just spoke to this guy.

193
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,980
Petre Novic. Old friend. Don't ask.

194
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,738
Anyway, he was the second-highest bidder

195
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,240
at a recent underground auction

196
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,013
for items pertaining to Cleopatra.

197
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,602
He was so pissed at being outbid,

198
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,743
he was practically begging
to rat out the winner.

199
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,554
Jessica Wong.

200
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,790
Chinese billionaire living in London.

201
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,692
Also having a black-tie party tonight

202
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,360
to show off her art collection.

203
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,362
Can Interpol get a warrant
to seize her records?

204
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,699
I can try, but it will be
difficult off hearsay

205
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,963
from a conversation
between two criminals.

206
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,135
Danny,

207
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:19,075
I could use your help.

208
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,642
Lexi.

209
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:33,385
They won't be able to get the warrant.

210
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,387
You need to go to that party tonight.

211
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,127
Get documentation on the sale.

212
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,924
Anything that can lead
us back to Farouk.

213
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,660
So, you're talking to me
now as a Brotherhood agent,

214
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,495
not the Carabinieri?

215
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,759
Well, generally speaking,
what works for one

216
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,266
works also for the other.

217
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,587
The Brotherhood has
intercepted some chatter,

218
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:51,560
believed to be from Farouk's group,

219
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,101
indicating that they are very
close to finding Cleopatra.

220
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,575
We need to find out where
they're digging in Europe.

221
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:57,848
But be careful.

222
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,055
Jessica Wong is not
some rich dilettante.

223
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,747
She's very dangerous.

224
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:04,398
We had an asset in her place once,

225
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,959
on a different mission.

226
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,447
The asset was apparently discovered

227
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,421
and never heard from again.

228
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,090
And you want me to go in tonight

229
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,393
because I'm expendable?

230
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,229
_

231
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,773
Okay, let's go over our cover.

232
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,403
Again?

233
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,415
Danny, you know I lie for a living?

234
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,940
Yeah, well, I don't.

235
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,575
Humor me.

236
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:37,978
We're here to buy a
statue for Jacob Reece.

237
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,316
You're Jack Stone,
his antiquities expert,

238
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:44,514
and I'm his art broker,

239
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,558
Winifred DeMontague.

240
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:47,983
I swear.

241
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:50,101
Do you read romance novels
when I'm not looking?

242
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,531
Those are real names of people

243
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:53,839
that work for Reece, in case she checks.

244
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,630
She'll have someone show you
the provenance for the piece.

245
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,565
Now, while I distract Jessica,

246
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,434
you get ahold of her financial records.

247
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,636
We got to find a link
from her to Farouk.

248
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:05,139
And then we put her in jail.

249
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:07,975
Well, I must be rubbing off on you.

250
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,894
You never cared about stopping

251
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,631
the blood antiquities trade before.

252
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:13,204
I couldn't care less about that.

253
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,810
I just want to punch her

254
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:17,584
in her stupid, entitled, rich-girl face.

255
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,494
To be fair, she is a
self-made billionaire CEO,

256
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,068
accomplished author, and philanthropist.

257
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,342
She sounds intolerable.

258
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,795
It's like a gilded dollhouse.

259
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,086
We have incoming.

260
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,026
Try to hold off on that face punching.

261
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,831
- No promises.
- Ms. Wong.

262
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,092
Such... a pleasure. Jack Stone.

263
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,666
I work with Mr. Reece's museum in Rome.

264
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,210
Yes. Jay said you're
the most knowledgeable

265
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,237
antiquities expert he's ever known.

266
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,178
I've been looking
forward to meeting you.

267
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,937
And this is Winifred DeMontague.

268
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:48,377
She'll be assessing the provenance

269
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,902
on the draped kouros.

270
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,809
Assuming everything is in order.

271
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:53,682
You'll find it impeccable.

272
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,823
My assistant will show you the way.

273
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,183
You know, I do have a fine

274
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,173
Makron in my collection.

275
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:11,738
It's a fragment of an
Olympian statue in marble.

276
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,640
Is this a test?

277
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,975
Whatever could you mean?

278
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,915
I mean that Makron did
a number of Olympians,

279
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,708
but they were all on the sides of urns

280
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,480
because he was a painter...

281
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:22,591
Not a sculptor.

282
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,534
Would you like some champagne?

283
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:27,634
I think you and I are going to

284
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,771
be very good friends, Mr. Stone.

285
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:33,659
I thought I recognized a familiar face.

286
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,143
Give us a sec, will you?

287
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,083
Simon. Hardwick.

288
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,703
I'm an old friend of Danny McNamara's.

289
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,082
Well, I say old friend. We
met each other once or twice.

290
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,312
Does Jessica know...

291
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,052
That he used to work for the FBI?

292
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,759
FBI? Quite a story.

293
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,761
Yes, and she'd be very
upset if she knew.

294
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,230
Which reminds me, last time I saw you

295
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,364
was in Rome.

296
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,837
Carlo Velardi's soirée...

297
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,763
Or should I say black market bazaar...

298
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,725
Where I chose not to reveal

299
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,334
Mr. McNamara's former
employment because...

300
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,541
He saved my life once...

301
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,910
And I owed him.

302
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,112
But today's a new day, isn't it?

303
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:07,914
Would you...

304
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,188
Care to join me outside on the terrace?

305
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,052
Ancient Greek.

306
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,166
Dynastic Chinese.

307
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,439
Mayan.

308
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,180
Celtic.

309
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,794
Well, it's clear that
your collection is...

310
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,402
Unified by one shared quality.

311
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:24,993
Every item is unique.

312
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,367
Like this Makron vase...
It's signed by him.

313
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,069
The only one of its kind.

314
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:32,105
So I passed another test?

315
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,436
And why would I need to test you?

316
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,337
Well, you put yourself through college

317
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,378
playing in an underground poker game.

318
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:40,413
I'm guessing old habits die hard.

319
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,882
Does Mr. Reece keep a dossier on me?

320
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,085
Just read your profile in Wired.

321
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,320
Preparation for our negotiation?

322
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:49,196
Total coincidence.

323
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,729
I was looking for
recommendations on a new TV.

324
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,219
You'll have to excuse me.

325
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,880
You know, Simon,

326
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,534
charming though you are, I must admit,

327
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,608
you have me at a disadvantage.

328
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:12,412
Well, I was going to
introduce myself in Rome,

329
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:14,611
but, alas, the place was
raided by the Carabinieri

330
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,544
- and I had to make a hasty exit.
- What a shame.

331
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,917
Indeed, it was.

332
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,725
Actually, on that point,
Carlo's a bit miffed.

333
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,790
Mm. He's under the impression
that you and Mr. McNamara

334
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:25,692
tipped off the police.

335
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:28,488
Now, I could always offer
to smooth things over

336
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,980
between the three of you?

337
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:32,932
You haven't even asked
for anything in return.

338
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:35,073
The thought of a quid pro
quo had occurred to me.

339
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,832
I hope that's not a euphemism.

340
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,745
Ah. Sweetheart, don't be coy,

341
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,685
or nobody's gonna find Cleopatra.

342
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:44,855
- What are you on about?
- I know all the players.

343
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,456
Karim Farouk.

344
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,193
The Brotherhood of Serapis.

345
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,133
And you and the Boy Scout in there.

346
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,174
To be fair, you and Mr. McNamara...

347
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,866
My dark horse bet in the race,

348
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,584
and I could make you
the frontrunner for a...

349
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,795
- Oh?
- Reasonable cut.

350
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,366
- Really?
- Let's say three-way split?

351
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,273
Well, watch out. Here comes Curly.

352
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,646
I have everything ready for you.

353
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:06,143
Wonderful.

354
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,680
Call me when you know something I don't.

355
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,548
Here's something for free.

356
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,483
Try Jessica's desk.

357
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,520
Like me, it's surprising.

358
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,294
I trust the papers are in order?

359
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,873
Do you have provenance
on the Phidian kouros?

360
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,996
I was only told to prepare

361
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:29,671
the documents for the draped kouros.

362
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:32,030
And the Phidian kouros.
We're looking at both.

363
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,236
My apologies.

364
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,838
I'll be back in a moment.

365
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,059
Jack.

366
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:52,322
Is everything okay?

367
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,491
Nice to meet you, Lexi Vaziri.

368
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,897
I trust you've met

369
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:59,129
Mr. Danny McNamara, formerly of the FBI.

370
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,763
Oh...

371
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:05,396
Why don't you tell me
who you're working for?

372
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:09,997
Take my phone. Breast pocket.

373
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,038
Call Agent Gwen Karlsson.

374
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,306
She'll confirm that you were identified

375
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:15,946
as a bidder in an illegal auction

376
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,354
for stolen Egyptian
relics from Karim Farouk.

377
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,250
Then ask her about that
van parked outside.

378
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,556
It's loaded with agents

379
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,915
ready to crash your party
with tear gas and rubber bullets

380
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:25,889
if they think that our
lives are in danger.

381
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,592
- You're bluffing.
- Oh, we don't bluff.

382
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:31,922
We're more of a "sure
thing" kind of operation.

383
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,741
We didn't exchange money directly.

384
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,807
I didn't know I was
dealing with a terrorist.

385
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,316
Save it. How'd you pay him?

386
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:50,757
I was told to purchase some useless land

387
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,330
through a shell company.

388
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,383
Where?

389
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:58,773
Spain.

390
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,423
The Andalucía mountains.

391
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,926
Wonderful.

392
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,261
Now...

393
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,071
Be a good girl,

394
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,146
and we won't tell Farouk you talked.

395
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:16,039
Let's get out of here before they

396
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,500
realize there's no van outside.

397
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:20,742
Well played. Now let's
hurry up and get to Spain.

398
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,169
_

399
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,624
Good news is, Farouk had Wong

400
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,316
purchase thousands of acres,

401
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:54,124
so he doesn't exactly know
where to look, either.

402
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,593
Maybe some of these locals
can tell us something here.

403
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:00,163
Hey, look at this.

404
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:03,867
"The Ghost Train of Sierra Perdida."

405
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,702
Looks like a tourist trap.

406
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,144
It's a real local legend from 1944.

407
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,718
Train came out of nowhere
and then disappeared.

408
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:14,075
Jessica Wong's land
purchase was along the same

409
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:16,249
railroad tracks that this
ghost train went missing.

410
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,256
And you think it's our lost Nazi train.

411
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,363
Hey. ¿Qué tal?

412
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:22,938
Hey, how's your Spanish?

413
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,411
Not as good as my Serbian.

414
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,584
Better than my Italian.

415
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,257
Probably as good as my French.

416
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,426
Are those all from ex-boyfriends?

417
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,417
I happen to have a
facility with languages.

418
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:33,372
Eh, I speak English.

419
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,174
Oh. Great.

420
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:39,269
We're interested in the Ghost
Train of Sierra Perdida.

421
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,209
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.

422
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:43,396
The area is all private property now.

423
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:44,402
Off-limits.

424
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,671
Ruined my tourism business.

425
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,179
Can you show us where?

426
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:53,516
The train was last spotted
at this station in Córdoba

427
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:56,519
but never arrived at this stop.

428
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,361
If the train derailed between stations,

429
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,529
it's possible it's still out there.

430
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,133
How much for the map?

431
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,168
15 euros.

432
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,171
It says five.

433
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,739
It's the last one.

434
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:19,242
50. 50, not 15.

435
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,805
I'm sorry, my English is not perfect.

436
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,603
I'm just gonna let
you two work this out.

437
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,440
Grab some of these supplies from you?

438
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:27,779
Oh, these supplies?

439
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,047
Oh, those are very special supplies...

440
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,321
Perfect. No service.

441
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,181
One time I ask for help.

442
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:36,354
How much for that hat?

443
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,061
One time.

444
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:43,224
Think I got a pretty
good deal on supplies.

445
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,902
Please tell me you got him
to throw in the hat for free.

446
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,237
Freeish.

447
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:49,072
And that is what happens when you come

448
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:51,379
from a culture that doesn't haggle.

449
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,043
Come on. Let's ride.

450
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:56,092
_

451
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:59,295
_

452
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:54,237
Lexi, bad girl.

453
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,023
Oh, I'm famished.

454
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:48,958
Got any food in there?

455
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,560
Let's see.

456
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:53,563
Folding shovels. Binoculars.

457
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,532
Oh, wait.

458
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:57,095
I think this is actually jerky.

459
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,035
Oh, yes.

460
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:03,740
Does jerky ever go bad?

461
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,303
What's that sound?

462
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:06,743
Me complaining.

463
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,751
Farouk's men.

464
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:17,813
But no Farouk.

465
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,223
They're digging way outside the X-marks.

466
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,225
There's a bridge with a sharp bend

467
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:24,132
a couple miles from here.

468
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:26,200
If the train derailed,

469
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:27,969
it happened there.

470
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:33,102
"They're digging in the wrong place."

471
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,104
Yeah, that's what I just...

472
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:37,507
Oh, God, is that from some movie?

473
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,543
Just forget it.

474
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,740
If you explain it to me,
I'll pretend to find it funny.

475
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,714
No, moment's gone.

476
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,130
Ooh.

477
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,547
There.

478
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,264
Mountain pass. Curve in the track.

479
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,533
Steep drop.

480
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,802
I think you're right.

481
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,403
Looks like the perfect spot

482
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:10,042
for a Nazi train to have
disappeared for 75 years.

483
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,976
Let's go check out what's
in that ravine ahead.

484
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,092
I thought we'd be there by now.

485
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,032
We should have brought way more food.

486
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:23,505
Huh.

487
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:32,829
We're officially in
the middle of nowhere.

488
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:37,955
No way.

489
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:46,609
- We found it.
- We found it.

490
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,260
Brilliant.

491
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,464
Now let's see if she's inside.

492
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,531
Crate's here, but no Cleopatra.

493
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,067
- Yeah, she's gone.
- Danny.

494
00:25:44,972 --> 00:25:47,070
Free booze.

495
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:51,074
Absinthe.

496
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:55,678
Strong absinthe.

497
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,682
Too late again.

498
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,318
I'd say you're right on time.

499
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,965
So, I finally caught up with you.

500
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:13,308
So, you found her.

501
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:14,981
We found what's left of a crate

502
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,454
and some old absinthe.

503
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:18,818
Cleopatra's long gone.

504
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:20,820
Well, we tried our best.

505
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:23,561
The adventure continues.

506
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:31,321
You two destroyed my bazaar,

507
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,428
ruined my reputation.

508
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:35,743
I lost millions that night,

509
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:38,066
and now I'm out here like a zoccola,

510
00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:41,007
shaking down treasure hunters
just to make up what I lost.

511
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:43,881
The people you're dealing with
aren't just treasure hunters.

512
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:45,612
They're terrorists.

513
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,280
Karim Farouk's people.

514
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:49,184
The guy who blew up the pyramid?

515
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,009
And that's Omar,

516
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,381
Farouk's right-hand man.

517
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:58,019
You know, I've been very
much looking forward

518
00:26:58,025 --> 00:26:59,893
to finally killing you.

519
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,561
You're 0 for 2, sport.

520
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,300
Any more jokes?

521
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,110
How about you, Fredo?

522
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,966
Or are you gonna run to Daddy?

523
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,907
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Shh, Luca. Shh.

524
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:18,478
You know, I really should thank you all.

525
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:20,346
The only thing my men could dig up

526
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:22,048
was a hole full of skeletons.

527
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,983
Never would have found this without you.

528
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,718
She's all yours

529
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:27,487
if you can dig her out of that car.

530
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:28,988
Fantastic.

531
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:31,257
I just need two volunteers to help dig.

532
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,067
_

533
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:53,246
Suspected members of the Brotherhood.

534
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:03,089
Vaziri.

535
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:05,091
Fathers and their secrets.

536
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:19,405
Hey.

537
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,741
Lexi Vaziri.

538
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,743
I need her phone number.

539
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,945
Huh?

540
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,214
Anything yet?

541
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,050
Still digging.

542
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:33,052
- Oh, come on.
- Just play along.

543
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,054
Found something!

544
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,963
Step aside.

545
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:45,965
We're coming down.

546
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:07,587
I need your lucky charm.

547
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:35,404
Luca, no!

548
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,697
Don't you dare.

549
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,151
Go. Go.

550
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,220
No!

551
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:41,062
We need to go.

552
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,782
Ever since I met you,

553
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,590
you've done nothing but take from me!

554
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,259
Why are we stopping?

555
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:03,700
I want to check something out first.

556
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,614
All right, we'd better hurry

557
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,068
and get the hell out of Spain

558
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:14,842
before Carlo comes looking for us.

559
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,475
Omar mentioned they
found skeletons here.

560
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,705
Got me curious.

561
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:34,631
Six Nazi uniforms but...

562
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:36,138
No bodies.

563
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,528
Found 'em.

564
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:44,033
Why did someone strip
off their uniforms?

565
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:49,752
Look at the scrap of this insignia.

566
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:51,259
It's a Casablanca regiment.

567
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,844
What the hell are they doing here?

568
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,529
Moroccan troops were brought in to

569
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:57,217
quash anti-Franco rebels in 1944.

570
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,701
Hmm.

571
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,952
Nine-millimeter.

572
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,725
A Luger?

573
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,066
We're not far from where
the train derailed.

574
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,318
Shoot-out in the train
for... whatever reason.

575
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,692
Surviving Nazis grab Cleopatra.

576
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:18,033
They come across these
Moroccans, kill them,

577
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:21,065
take their uniforms, and
head straight to Morocco.

578
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:23,006
Best way to get Cleopatra out of Europe.

579
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:24,470
So they went to Casablanca.

580
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,737
That's what it looks like.

581
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,911
It's the closest and
largest port in Morocco.

582
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:30,986
Omar had the answer in his hands,

583
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,259
and he didn't even know it.

584
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:34,967
Ah, but he didn't have a Danny.

585
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,707
Thanks.

586
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:41,552
Oh, of course.

587
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:43,759
Now we have reception.

588
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,565
Hey, before we go to Casablanca,

589
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,553
can we stop in Rome?

590
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,503
Sure.

591
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,943
Something wrong?

592
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:56,223
Farouk's letter to my dad.

593
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:58,470
I sent it to someone to see
if she could restore it,

594
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,777
maybe help me make some sense of it.

595
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,779
Oh, she find anything?

596
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,715
She won't tell me what
she found over text.

597
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,176
Said it's not safe.

598
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,887
What if it's true?

599
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,290
What if my dad worked with Farouk?

600
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,627
Look, I knew your dad to be a good man.

601
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:20,063
But whoever he was,
it doesn't define you.

602
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,900
You're the sum of your own choices.

603
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:25,241
That's not exactly reassuring.

604
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,452
_

605
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,814
Hey.

606
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:40,521
- You.
- You.

607
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,965
You two know each other?

608
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:44,008
He's tried to arrest
me, like, ten times.

609
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:46,643
You said you went to a
restorer, not a forger.

610
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,286
Master forger.

611
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,659
Allegedly.

612
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:51,061
He's not here for you.

613
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,667
You can trust me trusting him.

614
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,808
What'd you find in the letter?

615
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:00,624
What's it say?

616
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,212
It doesn't matter what it says.

617
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:05,120
It's as fake as the Botticelli
hanging in the National Gallery.

618
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,311
- I knew it.
- Danny.

619
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:07,408
Sorry.

620
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:09,181
I found a sample of Farouk's writing

621
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:10,620
from an early manifesto.

622
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:12,027
It's a good forgery,

623
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,834
but the numbers in
the date give it away.

624
00:34:15,426 --> 00:34:17,794
There are ink blots over
the numbers 8 and 9.

625
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:20,230
Whoever wrote it hesitated
over the curved lines

626
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:22,199
and pressed the pen too much.

627
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,700
It's called criminal tremor.

628
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,702
Why would someone implicate my father

629
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,204
as having worked with Farouk?

630
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:32,109
I-I need to get some air.

631
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:41,718
I thought she'd be happy.

632
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,388
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she
doesn't know how to feel.

633
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:46,184
If her father was a bad guy,

634
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,924
at least his death wasn't her fault.

635
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:52,843
I guess those checks won't
stop going out anytime soon.

636
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:54,831
What checks?

637
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:57,696
Most of her money goes

638
00:34:57,702 --> 00:34:59,285
to the families affected by

639
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,976
the bombing that killed her father.

640
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:02,973
I had no idea.

641
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,742
I don't think she wants anyone to know.

642
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:08,145
I make everything look like
legit insurance payouts

643
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,914
so nobody asks questions.

644
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,858
_

645
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,007
Fabi.

646
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:32,054
You don't need to announce it
for the whole neighborhood.

647
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,498
Well, you don't need to creep up on me.

648
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,567
If you answered your phone, you'd
know I've been looking for you.

649
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:38,479
We were in the mountains in Spain.
I didn't have reception.

650
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:40,759
Found the Nazi train.

651
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:41,865
Yes, I know.

652
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:44,481
Interpol is all over
what's going on there.

653
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:46,149
Agent Karlsson suspects
your involvement,

654
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:47,876
and she is not pleased.

655
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:50,450
She wants to bring you
both in for questioning.

656
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:53,224
You need to plan your
next move carefully, Lexi.

657
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,920
Yeah, well, it's always better to ask

658
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:56,326
for forgiveness than permission.

659
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:59,162
When we find Cleopatra,
all will be forgiven.

660
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,731
- So you're close?
- They took it to Casablanca.

661
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,166
Headed out first thing.

662
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,334
Good.

663
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:09,473
Did you find anything about my dad

664
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,575
in that file I stole in Cairo?

665
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:13,844
Ghazal had a letter in his vault I...

666
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,479
Forgot to tell you about.

667
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:16,847
You forgot?

668
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:19,249
Look, I had to find out for myself.

669
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:21,017
Someone forged that letter

670
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:24,321
and made it look like my
dad was working with Farouk.

671
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,159
I've been going through the Farouk file.

672
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:31,328
The half you were able
to retrieve, anyway.

673
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,265
Your father was the one who originally

674
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,437
found the documents
among Farouk's things.

675
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,033
It seemed he called Ghazal

676
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:39,202
to confirm something that concerned him.

677
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,404
I think that's what got him killed.

678
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:43,740
Ghazal tipped off Farouk?

679
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:45,509
I believe so.

680
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:47,444
We are monitoring him.

681
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,384
Do not make any hasty moves.

682
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,043
You want to know the
truth about your father,

683
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,282
why he was killed,

684
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,583
trust us.

685
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:54,918
Trust you...

686
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:58,855
Must be Danny.

687
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:00,257
Go.

688
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,363
Hey.

689
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,550
Hey.

690
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,447
What?

691
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:17,176
You have more of your dad's
goodness in you than you let on.

692
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:19,384
He'd be really proud of you.

693
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:24,581
I've got a lead on a
place to stay tonight.

694
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:26,316
Gonna go check it out.

695
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:28,151
Okay.

696
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:31,143
Well, just in case, I'm
working on a plan B.

697
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:37,961
Good night.

698
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,550
Y-Y-You won't even notice us.

699
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,746
We're barely in Rome.

700
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,801
But why's it got to be my place?

701
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:52,475
Hey, "blessed are those
that feed the hungry",

702
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:53,777
"clothe the naked,

703
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:55,674
"shelter the homeless..."

704
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,015
You do not want to go toe-to-toe
with me on Bible verses.

705
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:00,889
Chuck, she's low on funds.

706
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:02,847
If she has a place to crash
for a night or two,

707
00:38:02,853 --> 00:38:04,154
she doesn't pick the pockets

708
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,228
of the old ladies you
see for confession.

709
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,092
It's a virtuous cycle.

710
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:12,140
Hmm? Fine.

711
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,432
But she pitches in for chores.

712
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:17,267
And no walking around naked.

713
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:19,269
I promise we'll respect your space.

714
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:20,575
You better.

715
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,348
I'm gonna text her to let her know.

716
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,309
I think she's trying to
find a place as we speak.

717
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:44,361
How'd you get my number?

718
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,963
Pleased to see you, too.

719
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:51,001
Jessica Wong's security team
can be quite resourceful,

720
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:52,836
- when they need to be.
- Ah.

721
00:38:52,903 --> 00:38:54,671
Look, you told me to give you a call

722
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,406
when I knew something that you didn't.

723
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:59,409
I've been looking into
the Brotherhood for a while.

724
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:01,411
Came across an old list of names.

725
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,847
Former members at some time or other.

00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:13,673
I'd say your father

729
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,077
