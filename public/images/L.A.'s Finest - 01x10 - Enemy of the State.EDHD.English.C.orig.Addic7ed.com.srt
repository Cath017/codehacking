1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,099
<i>Previously on "L.A.'s Finest"...</i>

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:06,765
Our victim over here is
Lonnie Emmons, 35 years old.

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,515
- Shot in the back three times.
- It's done.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,896
He would've gotten us all caught.
You know that.

5
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:13,169
Mrs. Emmons, we believe your husband
may have been involved

6
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:14,693
in a heist at the diamond reserve.

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,237
- Possibly with Romeo.
- It's always the cleaning crew, huh?

8
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,409
I told you I'd be back for my money,

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,761
- you son of a bitch!
- I got $500 in my pocket right now...

10
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:23,544
- You're coming with me, Romeo.
- LAPD!

11
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,717
You need to make sure I make bail.

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,948
I came here yo help.

13
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:29,381
What did you... What did you do?

14
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:34,569
- Get on the ground! Don't move!
- What's going on? Who are you?

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,728
Dante Sherman is a fugitive.

16
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,407
You're ready to be honest with me?

17
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:39,821
Dante, who is he to you?

18
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:41,829
You're leaving?

19
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,141
You're not even gonna say goodbye?

20
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:45,758
Nina Beckham. Bishop Duvall.

21
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,609
She's a long-lost friend from Miami.

22
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,960
One of Syd's cover names
in Miami was Nina Beckham.

23
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,164
Hello, Nina's friend. What's your name?

24
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,093
- Jodee.
- We had an agreement.

25
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,960
Your job is to make sure
the DEA is an asset,

26
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:57,155
- not not an adversary.
- And I held up my end.

27
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:58,421
I'm investigating a rumor

28
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,316
of corruption in the police department.

29
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,238
I've sent you the file.

30
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,339
- Nico?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,043
I'm your brother-in-law, Patrick.
Can I come in?

32
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,803
Nina Beckham!

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,338
Look at you!

34
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,195
- I love the suit.
- When you called the meeting,

35
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,890
I assumed you meant business attire.

36
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:25,958
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,514
Let's not go getting ahead of ourselves.

38
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,563
We're not in business together yet.

39
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:30,683
Then what am I doing here?

40
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,154
Oh, this is just a simple, little test

41
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,994
to see how you react to... spontaneity.

42
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,266
All right.

43
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:41,179
Thank you.

44
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,651
Which one?

45
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,411
The little one on the right.

46
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:49,563
- Nice.
- This is what you do for fun?

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,410
Today. We'll see what tomorrow brings.

48
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,675
I got one more target for you.

49
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:58,138
All right.

50
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,163
This way.

51
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,515
What the hell is this?

52
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,298
This is a Metzger.

53
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:12,090
Metzger here used to clean my cash

54
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:15,291
until I found out
that he was gonna sell me out.

55
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,763
So what's he doing here, Bishop?

56
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:20,795
Loyalty, or as in his lack thereof,

57
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:25,050
and your prerequisite for the job.

58
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,130
You want me to shoot him?

59
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,658
I just want a demonstration
of your loyalty.

60
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:34,906
Come on.

61
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,082
What's it gonna be, Nina?

62
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,906
I get it. So a mutual friend

63
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:40,186
recommends that we work together,

64
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:42,330
but since you've never heard of me,

65
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,699
you think I'm small-time.

66
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,994
But the gag is, Bishop, so are you,

67
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,562
which is probably why you feel like

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,315
you got to play games in order
to prove that you're legit.

69
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,362
Honey, I was moving millions
in South Beach

70
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,506
while you were still selling dime bags

71
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,331
in the Venice canals.

72
00:03:58,428 --> 00:03:59,899
You want to measure dicks?

73
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,235
Call your little goons and buy a ruler.

74
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,986
You want to talk business,
call me when you grow up.

75
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:11,034
Nina, wait.

76
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,170
You're so uptight!

77
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,930
The thing's not even loaded.

78
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,787
Look, I had this whole thing planned.

79
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,162
You were gonna pull the trigger,

80
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,874
and I was gonna be like, "Whoa!
Man, this chick is legit loyal!"

81
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,218
Metzger's not my money guy.

82
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,971
He's just a buddy of mine
who lost a bet.

83
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,499
But you're a pro,
so let's talk business.

84
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:34,619
Let's.

85
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,858
Okay, so, I did my research on you.

86
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:39,771
You found a new way to turn small bills

87
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:42,266
into big bills.

88
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:45,275
Vending machines...
Unregulated cash business

89
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,899
operating solely on ones and fives.

90
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,554
I cleaned more than $50 million
before the feds caught on.

91
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:51,962
That's brilliant.

92
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,194
But don't you think a
relationship as dynamic as ours

93
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,755
might need something new,
something unique?

94
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,898
I mean, what do you say?

95
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:01,082
Consider it done.

96
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,842
All right.

97
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,299
Oh, Nina.

98
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,250
This is gonna be fun.

99
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,218
Hey.

100
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:25,851
Thanks for coming so fast.

101
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:30,010
Yeah, I'm actually glad you called.

102
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,482
Nice house, Nance.

103
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,066
Don't be too hard on him.

104
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,979
I'm the one who thought it'd be
better to talk at your place.

105
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,450
Dante threatened to cut a deal
in exchange

106
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,922
for what he knows
about your mother's death.

107
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,362
When we catch him, and we will,

108
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,890
- he's gonna tell what he knows.
- You ain't catching Dante.

109
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,098
And even if you did, he ain't talking.

110
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:48,474
Nico, things are different now.

111
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:49,882
He's desperate.

112
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,731
They may be different for you,
but Dante ain't no snitch.

113
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:53,850
Got to get ahead of this.

114
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,611
The only way to protect the both of you

115
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,858
is for Nico to turn himself in.

116
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,714
- What?!
- No. That ain't happening.

117
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:01,818
You were 12 years old, and it's
a clear case of self-defense.

118
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,322
You were both victims of abuse.

119
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,730
We can plead Nico down to manslaughter.

120
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:07,258
I can get the judge to consider
trying him as a juvenile,

121
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:09,818
but only if he shows
good faith and comes forward.

122
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,546
- You okay with this, Nancy?
- No. No!

123
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,403
I... This is the first time
I'm hearing about this!

124
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,186
- Dante's not gonna tell!
- What if he does?

125
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,226
I mean, we were...

126
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:25,979
We were underage.

127
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,978
And they would have medical records

128
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:32,538
that would show a pattern of abuse.

129
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,650
Dante's got our backs.

130
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:37,595
Always has, always will.

131
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:42,522
If a warrant goes out for Nico,
there's nothing more I can do.

132
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,858
I just... I just...
I just need some time to think.

133
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:50,394
Think? Think about what?

134
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,026
I ain't turning myself in.

135
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,058
Nico...

136
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,539
What if Patrick's right?

137
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,074
Yeah?

138
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,834
What if he's not?

139
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,538
Don't worry about it.

140
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,491
I got this.

141
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,674
How could you put me in this position?!

142
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,826
I was trying to protect you.

143
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,002
By going to my brother?

144
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,210
How'd you even find him?

145
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,274
Oh, my God.

146
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:32,123
- You had me investigated.
- I was investigating Dante.

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,594
Besides, we have bigger problems
right now.

148
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:36,059
- What could possibly be bigger than this?
- Dante isn't the only one

149
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,138
who knows your secret.
Someone is after Syd,

150
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:41,082
and they are using
you and Nico as leverage.

151
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,234
Who?

152
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:43,802
A woman came to me...

153
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,971
A high-profile fixer.

154
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,090
Her name is Carlene Hart.

155
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:49,562
Dan Howser told me
that I could trust her.

156
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,811
Clearly, it was a mistake.

157
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,250
Clearly.

158
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,138
She gave me a file on Syd.

159
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:56,922
Arson, possession,
redistribution of fentanyl.

160
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,554
Doesn't look good.

161
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,075
It's not what it looks like.

162
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,026
Carlene is a power player.

163
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,850
She is pressuring me to investigate Syd,

164
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,835
or she comes forward
about your mom's murder.

165
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,618
One accusation from this woman,

166
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:16,858
and our lives are torn apart.

167
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,578
So you decided that...

168
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,450
...Nico should turn himself in.

169
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:26,362
It is the only way we get out
from under this secret,

170
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,282
- and I can help.
- How?

171
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,075
How is this helping?

172
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,674
I'd have to recuse myself from the case,

173
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,530
but I could protect your brother
from the sidelines.

174
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,227
You can't guarantee that.

175
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,715
And, besides, it's never
the crime, it's the cover-up.

176
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,538
And we've been hiding this

177
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:43,546
and lying about this for 20 years.

178
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:46,618
If this goes sideways,
Nico's life is ruined.

179
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:50,138
I could get fired.
Your career will be destroyed.

180
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,538
And we haven't even talked about Izzy.

181
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,234
Izzy will understand.

182
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,834
Okay, whatever comes from this,

183
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,882
we will face the consequences together.

184
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,314
It's going to come to light
one way or the other.

185
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,234
These things always do.

186
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,210
At least my way, we can
have a handle on it.

187
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:08,186
Just talk to Nico.

188
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,235
I'll think about it.

189
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:21,563
Still pissed at your husband, huh?

190
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,242
This whole Nico thing is just...

191
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,066
It sucks.

192
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,410
I hate to say it, but I really think

193
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,170
Patrick was just trying to help.

194
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,930
Don't take his side.

195
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:33,594
Okay. Enjoy your rage.

196
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,586
Get it out.

197
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,890
Do you remember her yet?

198
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,330
Show me the picture one more time.

199
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,218
Carlene Hart.

200
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,090
Holy shit. I think I met her
at Patrick's presser.

201
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,498
Thought she was trying to pick me up.

202
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

203
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,050
You think she works for Gabriel Knox?

204
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,130
Who else would try
to come at me so hard?

205
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,962
- Have Patrick look into me.
- What?

206
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,754
- Yeah.
- No way.

207
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:12,154
I'm not letting you take a hit
for something I started.

208
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,690
Besides, we covered our tracks.

209
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,770
"Covered our tracks"... that
just makes us sound so guilty.

210
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,338
I know, right? So what do we do?

211
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,026
<i>We</i> don't do anything.

212
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:22,522
This is between me and Nico.

213
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,474
You need to worry about...

214
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,194
how to get Bishop Duvall's
money laundered.

215
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,602
Did you get approval from LAPD?

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,586
Oh, LAPD can't be trusted.

217
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:33,274
You can't exactly do this alone.

218
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:36,282
Alone? You think I'm leaving
"Jodee" on the sidelines?

219
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,138
Hell no.

220
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,770
I got a plan.

221
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:41,882
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah? Huh?

222
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,314
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

223
00:10:58,204 --> 00:10:59,354
Get that out of my face.

224
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:00,570
You scared the shit out of me.

225
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:02,394
Damn. Who else could it have been?

226
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,274
Oh, I don't know. The D.A.?

227
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,642
Oh, bro, relax. He doesn't even
know you're here.

228
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,826
Neither does Nancy.

229
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:12,154
Why was he here?

230
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,938
He knows about my mom.

231
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,050
Yeah. They want me to confess,

232
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:19,386
- turn myself in.
- What?

233
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:21,018
Yeah, bro. You got them all scared

234
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,810
after you told them you were gonna talk.

235
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:26,266
I mean, you really weren't gonna
say anything, right?

236
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,442
I don't know.

237
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,586
Well, I do.

238
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:32,634
Man, they put you in a shitty position.

239
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,618
I mean, Nancy shouldn't
have arrested you.

240
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:36,762
I didn't really give her much choice.

241
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,482
- No, man.
- I killed that bastard Arlo.

242
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,034
Had to, for Ray.

243
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,826
I can't believe you did this.

244
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,874
- Perez is gonna be pissed.
- Her bad for telling me

245
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,954
she was gonna get you
sent to the hospital.

246
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,178
I hope my boys didn't, uh, mess you up

247
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,066
when they snatched you
out of that ambulance.

248
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:57,754
Oh, I been through worse.

249
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,322
Look, I-I don't want to ruin things

250
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,234
between you and your sister.

251
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:04,118
She's taking care of that herself.

252
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,346
Your boy, uh, Patel, he's coming
through with those new I.D.s?

253
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,714
Yeah, tomorrow.

254
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,434
Hey.

255
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,970
I really appreciate this.

256
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,570
Come on, man.

257
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:24,026
You've always been there for me,
even when she wasn't.

258
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,202
I'm just returning the favor, man.

259
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:30,458
- Cheers, brother.
- Cheers.

260
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,450
This place is not up
to my usual standards.

261
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,338
I mean, the wiring's a hot mess,

262
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:44,729
ambience certainly leaves a lot
to be desired,

263
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,138
but I'll make do.

264
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:48,026
How long did you say
this guy's gonna be here?

265
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,938
Just, like, a few days. Or... weeks.

266
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,442
Give or take.

267
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,233
Can I get you something?

268
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,153
I don't drink. My body's a temple.

269
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:57,370
More like a tent pole.

270
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,218
So all the men in your family
have anger issues.

271
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,330
- I get it.
- You said you wanted to help,

272
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,506
and this is what I need.
I need a secure location

273
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,002
for Nina's money-laundering operation.

274
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,586
I mean, this is... it's not
exactly sanctioned by the LAPD.

275
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,050
Everything is "need to know."

276
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:14,714
And this guy needs to know?

277
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:17,658
He's got a specialized skill set.
Which reminds me...

278
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,418
Hey, Fletch,

279
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,242
I need you to write some malware.

280
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,618
I need a backdoor into Bishop's computer

281
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:23,610
to track his financials.

282
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,890
Once we gather enough information

283
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,458
on Bishop's businesses,
we'll be able to trace

284
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,018
which ones are legit
and which ones are just fronts

285
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:31,258
for his fentanyl import operation.

286
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,346
Easy peasy.

287
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,106
I'll just hack into his cloud right now.

288
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,473
No can do. Bishop doesn't use his
cloud for anything important.

289
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,489
No, not unless you're into big butts.

290
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,665
- And if I were?
- Listen, I need you to focus.

291
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,674
We got to figure out a way
to launder Bishop's money.

292
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,050
In my day, it was all casinos...

293
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,610
No better way to explain
an influx of cash.

294
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,554
Oh. That'd be cool if Nina had a casino.

295
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:52,602
- Hmm.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

296
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,690
Big butts?

297
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:55,834
I love the way you think. No.

298
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:57,018
Online gambling.

299
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,066
I'll give you the backdoor
access on a thumb drive.

300
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,338
Ol' Fletcher's about to hook you up.

301
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,258
Well, as much fun as this is,

302
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,754
that diamond heist homicide case

303
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:08,314
is not gonna solve itself,
so we gotta jet.

304
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,138
Thank you for the drink.

305
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,354
You all right with this?

306
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,730
And what about these lights?

307
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:14,554
They're killing my eyes.

308
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,378
Do I have a choice?

309
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,194
No.

310
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,178
Didn't think so.

311
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:26,522
Tony Smith, A.K.A. Romeo,

312
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,210
was murdered "Sweeney Todd" -style

313
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,258
as he reached
for the framed dollar bill.

314
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:32,761
So you're into musicals now?

315
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:33,914
Been into musicals always.

316
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,194
This kid loves musicals.

317
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,114
Anyway, the dollar bill had the name

318
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,298
Jack Duffy written on it.

319
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:39,706
Looks like it was pulled from the wall.

320
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:41,849
First dollar bill, first customer.

321
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,114
But why go for a...

322
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,506
dollar bill over a phone,
you know, call for help?

323
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,137
Feeling sentimental? Who knows?

324
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:51,770
Or maybe he's trying to point us
to his killer.

325
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:52,890
That's a leap.

326
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,670
So you think Jack Duffy is the killer?

327
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:56,826
Here's what we know.

328
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:59,930
Romeo killed Lonnie at the oil field.

329
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,490
Okay, so, Romeo kills Lonnie,
takes his car,

330
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:03,802
which we still haven't found yet.

331
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,457
Then he tries to fence the diamonds,

332
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:07,834
which led us to the barber shop.

333
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:11,482
And M.E. says that Romeo caught
two different beat-downs

334
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,754
before he was actually killed. Here.

335
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,762
Okay, so somebody finished the job.

336
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,714
Our guys canvassed the area
around the barber shop,

337
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,314
and witnesses say that they saw Romeo

338
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:23,033
with a known loan shark
named Frank Leon.

339
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,730
So Frank Leon could be our killer.

340
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,162
Ergo, somebody's got to question Frank,

341
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,882
and somebody's got to track down
every Jack Duffy in L.A.

342
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,514
- Dibs on Frank.
- Nu... Mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.

343
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:33,114
- Don't work that way.
- Yes, yes, yes.

344
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,905
- What?
- We... How about we flip for it?

345
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,666
- Fine.
- You call it.

346
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,898
Uh, tails. Duh.

347
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:40,986
- Damn it!
- Boom!

348
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,185
I'm halfway through those
Jack Duffys, Detective Burnett.

349
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,394
I appreciate the opportunity.

350
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,154
You're welcome, rook.

351
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,226
Heads.

352
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,337
Well played, Detective Burnett.

353
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,449
You get your steps in?

354
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:08,794
No, man.

355
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,066
Michelle's gonna be pissed.
We're on this new, stupid diet,

356
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:12,474
and somehow, I'm gaining weight.

357
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,810
Pregnancy pounds.

358
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,474
You're eating everything
that your wife is eating,

359
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,361
but she's eating for twins.

360
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,441
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Michelle's a vegan.

361
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,914
How are you gaining weight eating grass?

362
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:23,321
I don't know.

363
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,826
How can I help you, detectives?

364
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:35,641
Word on the street is
Frank Leon's the man to talk to

365
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:37,594
if you're looking for a loan.

366
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,385
I'm just a helpful friend, okay?

367
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,666
Loaning money isn't a crime.

368
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:42,746
Nope, but murder is.

369
00:16:42,844 --> 00:16:44,858
Tony Smith, A.K.A. Romeo,

370
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:47,706
but you know that already.

371
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,337
I can't get money from a dead guy.

372
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:51,834
So you just roughed him up a little bit?

373
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:52,921
Romeo might have been the type

374
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,649
that occasionally needed
a little incentive.

375
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,057
When was the last time you saw him?

376
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:57,658
I collected a payment on a friendly loan

377
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:58,841
about a day or two ago.

378
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:00,730
- He pay you in full?
- No.

379
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:03,577
But he felt bad,
so he left me his cellphone,

380
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:06,009
me being such a good friend and all.

381
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:09,497
You mean he left you collateral.

382
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,962
Don't make this hard, Frank.

383
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,001
I'll tell you what. Out of
sympathy for my dead friend...

384
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,826
...you can have it.

385
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:22,362
Hopefully, it'll help you
find the bastards

386
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,274
and buy your man Frank here
a little bit of goodwill.

387
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,322
We'll be in touch.

388
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,634
Be where we can find you, Frank.

389
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:30,617
Oh, yeah.

390
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,649
Pricks.

391
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:25,018
According to his phone
on the day of the heist,

392
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,065
Romeo left the diamond reserve
to the oil field

393
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,921
where he killed Lonnie,
and then he came here.

394
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,026
See, this is why I turn
my location services off.

395
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:35,385
I don't need my phone
keeping tabs on my every move.

396
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:36,345
My wife handles that.

397
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:37,850
Well, this also says that last week,

398
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:41,242
he went to Me Llamo Taco three times.

399
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,514
We should definitely
check that place out.

400
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:44,793
- Hell no.
- What?

401
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,746
I am not sitting in the car
with your vegan ass

402
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,922
as you load up on refried beans.

403
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,130
Hey. Are you the manager?

404
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:52,985
- Yeah.
- Detective Walker.

405
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,010
This is Detective Baines.

406
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,186
Mind if we ask you a few questions...

407
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,306
Terrence?

408
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,289
- Shoot.
- All right.

409
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,009
You recognize any of these gentlemen?

410
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,922
They were murdered.

411
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,873
- Nope.
- We have reason to believe

412
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:10,234
that a Camaro belonging to one
of the victims was dumped here.

413
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,833
Mm.

414
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,457
Nope. We didn't crush
any Camaros this week.

415
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,994
Oh, that's weird.

416
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,201
- What?
- This is one of the victims' phones,

417
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,689
and in his contacts is
someone named Terrence Jones.

418
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:27,002
Oops.

419
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,474
Phone's ringing, Terry.

420
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:31,993
You gonna answer that,
or you think you know who it is?

421
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:51,866
Why'd you have to call him?!

422
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,162
Okay. I know white men can't jump,

423
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,577
but you could've made that.

424
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:13,903
What, you think I'm gonna
let him just get away?

425
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,993
Give me a little credit.
Let's get to the car.

426
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:20,314
Cops came to see me at work.
We got to get out.

427
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,553
Whoa. Slow down. What happened?

428
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,250
A couple cops came to see me at work,

429
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,617
asking all sorts of questions
about Squeaky and Romeo.

430
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:28,185
Told you it was a bad idea to kill them.

431
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,778
You didn't complain
when we split their shares.

432
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,146
I'd feel better if the take had
been what it's supposed to be.

433
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:36,569
Would you shut up about the take?

434
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,458
The cops came to see you,

435
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:41,338
and you came straight here?

436
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,329
Yeah.

437
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:44,154
And the app says we're here.

438
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,042
There's Terry's truck.

439
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:52,569
Tracks your steps and your bad guys.

440
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,201
Say it. I'm a genius.

441
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,801
Yeah, you have your moments.

442
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:59,162
Yo, I bet Terry's not
a real-estate agent on the side.

443
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:04,153
We got to go now!
They could've followed you.

444
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:07,098
I drove a dummy route.
Made sure no one tailed me.

445
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:09,401
Hey, Terrence, remember us? LAPD.

446
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,577
I don't think any of you
actually live here.

447
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:12,922
That's a B&E, right, Walker?

448
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,457
That's correct, Baines.

449
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,665
All right, put your hands up. Let's go.

450
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:32,729
Izzy, what's up?

451
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:40,954
Okay. So...

452
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,393
I think I figured out

453
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,241
why my dad and Nancy have been

454
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,353
fighting so much.

455
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,601
Yeah?

456
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:51,577
Yeah.

457
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,242
Who's Nico Perez?

458
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,873
"Perez?"

459
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,377
Isn't that your step-mom's maiden name?

460
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,873
I assumed it was.

461
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:01,401
But my dad has a ton of files
on this guy.

462
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,858
And look.

463
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,713
Wait. Isn't that your step-mom?

464
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:09,881
I think they used to be married
while she was in the Navy.

465
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,585
You think this guy's her ex-husband?

466
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,697
Why else would my dad
be so mad about him?

467
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,809
He could be trying to get Nancy back.

468
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,185
I found him.

469
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,369
Ohh.

470
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,225
I get why we're here.

471
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:24,825
Your parents removed their credit card

472
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:27,421
from your PHAST account
after your little prison field trip...

473
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:28,451
Your what?

474
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,352
...and we're your only
two friends with cars.

475
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,090
And my only two friends
who I would trust

476
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:33,849
to get in big trouble with.

477
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,513
Great.

478
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:39,162
So, what are you even gonna say to him?

479
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,409
I don't know.

480
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:42,202
Man, tell him to step off.

481
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,385
Don't mess with your family.

482
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,305
- Yeah. That.
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:47,673
Well, I can't go. I have a thing.

484
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,049
- What thing?
- Just a thing.

485
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,553
We haven't even set a time yet.

486
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:51,929
Yeah, it's... it's an all-day thing.

487
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:54,041
- I'll drive you.
- Really?

488
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,130
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

489
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,562
I mean, if it really means
that much to you.

490
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,322
Yes. Thank you.

491
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,273
- Thank you.
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.

492
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,265
I'm gonna go get popcorn.

493
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,537
You're welcome.

494
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:15,290
I'm not doing anything tomorrow.

495
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:18,233
Oh, my God. You are the worst.

496
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,609
And the best.

497
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,681
I know.

498
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:28,409
Do you ever think about

499
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,617
what comes after?

500
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,369
You getting spiritual on me?

501
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:36,185
Life after Knox, Syd.

502
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,785
Like, L.A... Would you stay here,

503
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:41,145
or would you come back home?

504
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:43,001
I don't know. Haven't
really thought about it.

505
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,593
A distraction.

506
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,409
Your life isn't a distraction, Syd.

507
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:51,033
I mean...

508
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,233
If anything, it should be the
reason why you even do this job.

509
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:55,833
So why do<i> you</i> still do it?

510
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,394
Mm.

511
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:00,153
Resolution.

512
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:02,137
I don't like leaving things unresolved.

513
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:04,121
Although, lately, I've been thinking

514
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:07,321
resolution is overrated.

515
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,954
I mean, look at us.

516
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:11,001
Hunting down Knox has already taken away

517
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,985
so much from us.

518
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,073
I mean, catching him...

519
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:17,209
we're never gonna get those years back.

520
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:19,193
Whatever it is that you're
working up the nerve to say,

521
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,601
why don't you just go ahead and say it?

522
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,905
Okay.

523
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,449
I want to try again, Syd.

524
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:31,034
Us.

525
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,105
But...

526
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:37,177
But what?

527
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,961
I don't think it's gonna work

528
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,425
if you can't let go of Knox.

529
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,729
I'm really close, Warren.

530
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:51,289
Close? Babe, the entire task force

531
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:53,177
has been shut down pending a review.

532
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,865
- They're...
- I know about the review.

533
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:58,073
Bishop made contact with Nina.

534
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,017
I'm on the inside, Warren.

535
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,906
I-I don't even know
why this surprises me.

536
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:10,009
This is... this is classic Syd Burnett,

537
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,865
always leaving me in the dark.

538
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:18,969
You know what really hurts?

539
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,881
You didn't even tell me
about the baby, Syd,

540
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,409
about... about our baby.

541
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:35,545
The reason I didn't tell you
I was pregnant

542
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:38,361
is 'cause I didn't know
if I wanted to keep it.

543
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,897
But it turns out...

544
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:49,881
...I had no idea
how badly I wanted that child

545
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,441
until it was taken away.

546
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:00,537
I wish you would've told me.

547
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:05,337
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,481
I'm sorry.

549
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:36,249
- Morning.
- Oh, my God.

550
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,537
Are you watching me while I sleep again?

551
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:43,417
'Cause you know I think
that's hella weird, right?

552
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,849
I'm kind of just hoping
I can get my arm back.

553
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,193
Boy?

554
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:55,673
I'm okay, baby.

555
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,433
Right.

556
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,289
I'll go get the coffee.

557
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,121
You know what? Wait.

558
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,169
Hold on a second.

559
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:34,201
His file says that he works here,

560
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:37,529
so this is who we're looking for.

561
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:39,417
Hmm. He doesn't really seem
like the type of guy

562
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,753
your step-mom would go for.

563
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:44,153
How do you know who Nancy would go for?

564
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,337
I-I don't know.

565
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:48,889
Just doesn't look like your dad?

566
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:50,521
This is a weird conversation.

567
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:53,337
Yeah.

568
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:56,473
No telling when he's gonna
get out of there.

569
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:57,849
Good point.

570
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,897
Look, it's him.

571
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:10,937
Uh, it's not too late
to turn back, you know?

572
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,537
I-If you're afraid, you know.

573
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,393
No. I'm doing this.

574
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,577
Hey! Stay away from my step-mom.

575
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,817
Leave Nancy alone.

576
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:24,089
Nancy? Uh...

577
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:26,329
You're Izzy?

578
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:28,121
Yeah, I mean, I see it now.

579
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:30,936
I mean, you look the different,
the... the hair.

580
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:32,248
I've seen pictures.

581
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,849
Okay, um, why have you seen photos?

582
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,801
Are you stalking us?

583
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,809
I'm... I'm sorry, who...
who do you think I am?

584
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,185
Nancy's ex-husband.

585
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,105
Hell no!

586
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,857
I'm her brother.

587
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,969
Told you he wasn't your step-mom's type.

588
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,793
Why don't you take a seat?

589
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,769
Uh, I'll give you guys some space.

590
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:06,297
Sit down.

591
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,033
Your, uh, jean-jacket buddy over there,

592
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:18,425
is he, uh, your boyfriend or something?

593
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,689
No. Just a friend.

594
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,025
His dad works with...

595
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,489
Nancy.

596
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:27,961
Right.

597
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:34,745
So is she, like, the wicked step-mother?

598
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:39,833
Well, she's, uh...

599
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:42,873
She's always in my business,

600
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:45,273
checking up on me, giving me lectures,

601
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,048
and making me talk about my feelings.

602
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:52,184
So she's a good mom.

603
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,521
Yeah.

604
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,921
Well, figures.

605
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,873
What, uh, was she like as a sister?

606
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,313
Uh...

607
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,513
Well, I mean,

608
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:14,297
exactly what you said.

609
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,985
More mom than sister, I guess?

610
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,225
Yeah.

611
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:22,585
Uh...

612
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:26,425
Why has she never mentioned you before?

613
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:31,641
About that.

614
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,305
Uh...

615
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,097
All right, so,
we didn't find any diamonds

616
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:37,113
on any of the suspects or the scene,

617
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,937
so we can only hold them
on breaking and entering.

618
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:41,337
We need one of them to confess
to the heist or Romeo's murder.

619
00:30:41,435 --> 00:30:42,681
Or they'll all walk.

620
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,953
Which one of them is the weakest link?

621
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,361
Jack Duffy.

622
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,801
This dude is arrogant as hell.

623
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:49,753
I say we play to his ego, you know?

624
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:52,249
We... we... we praise Romeo
for planning the robbery

625
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:55,257
and hope, eventually,
he tries to take credit.

626
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,408
What about Josephine?

627
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,233
I mean, she's the only woman
in the crew.

628
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,736
I could sympathize with her

629
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,785
'cause I'm also surrounded
by incompetent men.

630
00:31:01,883 --> 00:31:03,161
No.

631
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:06,104
Nah. I think we should
focus on Terrence.

632
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,441
He already ran, and he's not
so keen about going to jail.

633
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:10,456
Ooh, ooh. Culinary con.

634
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:12,985
- Yeah. Let's do that.
- Let's do it.

635
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:14,553
Yeah.

636
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,601
We searched the junkyard, Terry.

637
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,849
This is the wheel cap to Lonnie's car.

638
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,889
I'm sorry... Squeaky's car.

639
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:27,736
Romeo killed Squeaky,
drove his car to the junkyard,

640
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,201
and you crushed it.

641
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,209
You destroyed evidence, man.

642
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:36,633
I don't know what you're talking about.

643
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,777
I mean, it's just really a shame,

644
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,528
'cause, I mean,
you did everything right,

645
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:45,624
but then your boy Terrence got scared

646
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:48,248
and brought the cops right to you.

647
00:31:50,395 --> 00:31:52,696
You're wasting your time.

648
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:55,705
None of us are gonna talk.

649
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,592
It must be pretty damn frustrating.

650
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,608
You break into the country's
most secure vault,

651
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:03,065
you get away clean, only to be
tripped up by incompetence.

652
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:04,185
Damn!

653
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:07,577
It was your plan, right?

654
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,785
Guess not.

655
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:12,569
Romeo masterminded the whole thing.

656
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,153
Is that why you killed him...
you were jealous?

657
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,616
I didn't kill anybody.

658
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:21,369
Romeo, he grabbed that

659
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,705
off the wall of his shop before he died.

660
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:26,457
I think he points us towards his killer.

661
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:30,265
That's pretty clever, if you ask me.

662
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:31,929
Congratulations.

663
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,776
You proved Romeo was my barber.

664
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:38,968
Yo. Got the burgers.

665
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:40,153
You get the extra ketchup?

666
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,496
'Cause we want our guy to be happy.

667
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:42,489
Yeah, of course I did.

668
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey.

669
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,864
Yo, I got to get these burgers to Duffy.

670
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:52,633
Jack's getting in-n-out?

671
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,913
He's cooperating,

672
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,544
so he gets the first-class treatment.

673
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:56,920
The guy with the suit, that's the D.A.

674
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,713
He came to hear Jack's confession.

675
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,600
Jack is saying that you killed Romeo.

676
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:07,320
Now, Jack... Jack's got it good.

677
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,049
Jack will probably do
5 to 10 for the heist,

678
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:10,360
but when you're talking
about a murder charge,

679
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,432
you're talking about 25 to life,
my friend.

680
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,577
Do you know how big a jail cell is?

681
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:18,809
It's probably smaller than this
room, and you're a big dude,

682
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,729
so your legs will probably
hang off the...

683
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,809
It wasn't me!

684
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:23,961
I-I want the deal.

685
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,433
It was Jack.

686
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:27,193
He killed Romeo.

687
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,017
'Cause he thought Romeo
was fencing the diamonds?

688
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:31,385
Yeah, he was attracting attention.

689
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:34,137
Jack went to talk to him, and...

690
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:37,528
well, things were tense
because of the double cross.

691
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,352
What double cross?

692
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:44,537
There was supposed to be
$10 million worth of diamonds

693
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:48,217
in the vault,
but we only got $1 million.

694
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:50,457
So Jack thought Romeo
was double-crossing him?

695
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:52,184
We all did.

696
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:53,945
After the heist,
Romeo and Squeaky drove off

697
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,128
with the diamonds.

698
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:57,336
We were gonna meet later
and split them up.

699
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,968
Romeo said he didn't do it.

700
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,153
Who else could it have been?

701
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:03,352
How does Squeaky's murder tie into this?

702
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,657
He was jumpy during the whole job.

703
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:07,256
Jack thought he'd talk.

704
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:09,208
Told Romeo to kill him.

705
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:17,048
Thank you.

706
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:19,161
That's all for now.

707
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,592
I-I like Papa John's.

708
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,616
What?

709
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,441
For when I talk to the D.A.?

710
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,904
Ah, sure.

711
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:29,561
I'll get right on that.

712
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,809
Extra cheese?

713
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:32,697
Yeah. Sure.

714
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,560
Yo, you save me one?

715
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,128
- You get a confession?
- Of course.

716
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:40,761
Terrence told us everything.

717
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:45,496
We know you killed Romeo.

718
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,353
You're going away for murder.

719
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,657
- Mmm.
- I'm hungry.

720
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,481
You can have the dollar back.

721
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:56,697
Oh, no. She's just playing you.
You can't keep evidence.

722
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:05,241
All right, Crockett and
Tubby, you both get gold stars.

723
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,857
- Tubby?
- Told you you was getting fat.

724
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:11,224
So we know that Romeo killed Squeaky,

725
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,401
and then Jack killed Romeo.

726
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,545
But do we believe him about
the whole double cross thing,

727
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:17,241
that they only got away with $1 million?

728
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:19,000
I do. I mean, it would be pretty stupid

729
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:21,081
for Romeo to steal the diamonds,
come back,

730
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:22,424
play dumb, and split them up.

731
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,985
I mean, why not just leave town
after killing Squeaky?

732
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,424
Right. Doesn't make any sense.

733
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:29,816
So we got $9 million
in diamonds missing.

734
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:31,161
Where'd they go?

735
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,728
What if they were never there?

736
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:34,264
O-or not never, but...

737
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:35,864
What do you mean?

738
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:38,009
All right, so, I worked undercover
on this crew once

739
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,336
that specialized
in safety-deposit vaults.

740
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,904
We knew how they were
getting into the vaults,

741
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,729
but we had no idea how
they knew which boxes to hit.

742
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,232
Then when I went undercover,
we figured out

743
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,992
that it was just an insurance scam.

744
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,449
So, the people who owned
the safety deposit boxes

745
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:54,233
would clear them out, tell
the crew which boxes to hit,

746
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,736
and then they collect
the insurance money.

747
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,273
They'd split the pay-out with the crew,

748
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:58,968
and they get to keep their valuables.

749
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:00,153
And all you go to do to pull that off

750
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:02,585
is to get an inside man
to get the jewelers

751
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:04,857
to agree to an insurance claim
and split the take.

752
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,361
- Exactly.
- So you think

753
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,345
Squeaky tipped off the jewelers?

754
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:10,328
Well, Terrence said that Squeaky

755
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:12,056
was extra jumpy during the robbery.

756
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:13,337
Yeah, and he definitely
knew the jewelers.

757
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,097
I mean, his cleaning service
had a contract

758
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:17,112
- with the diamond reserve.
- Wait.

759
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,928
Squeaky owned the business
with his wife, Marisol,

760
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:23,289
so she would've had access
to the jewelers, as well, right?

761
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:24,568
Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,808
But if we're right,
and the jewelers were in on it,

763
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,913
it's not like they're gonna
admit to it or press charges.

764
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,896
She'll get away with it.

765
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:43,961
I just... I really need
something to tell my kids.

766
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,465
Did you find who did this?

767
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:47,512
Yes, we did...

768
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,696
Your boy Romeo.

769
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:51,576
Or you know him as Tony Smith.

770
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,679
He's the one that killed Lonnie.

771
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,056
Tony was also murdered, unfortunately.

772
00:36:58,074 --> 00:36:59,800
I...

773
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:02,072
I had told Lonnie I had
a feeling about Tony,

774
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,288
- but I never thought...
- Drop the act.

775
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:04,760
We know what you did.

776
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:05,881
What I did?

777
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:08,569
You knew about the robbery
the entire time.

778
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,329
You know, I'm... I'm curious.

779
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:14,712
Was it his idea, or was it your idea?

780
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,953
To warn the jewelers and then negotiate

781
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,448
a cut of the insurance money
they were gonna get.

782
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:21,208
Who... who came up with that?

783
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,544
Prove it.

784
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:29,304
We can't.

785
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:30,553
But good luck trying
to spend all that money,

786
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,961
'cause we will be watching your ass.

787
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,872
Your cleaning business clears,
what, $80,000 a year?

788
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,616
How will you explain
your new car or new house?

789
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,089
If Lonnie didn't go through
with that heist,

790
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,256
then your insurance scam
does not pay off.

791
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:46,232
So he did that shit for you,
and you got him killed.

792
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,041
How are you gonna explain that
to those kids?

793
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:53,177
Hmm?

794
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,296
Hey.

795
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:08,089
Ride's almost here.

796
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,880
You okay?

797
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:15,769
No, man. I been thinking a lot.

798
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,376
I'm sorry, bro.

799
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:23,736
You went to jail because Nancy
and I needed money to run away,

800
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,200
and then after my mom,
you had to take care of me.

801
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:30,488
Maybe you and Ray would have
had a different life

802
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:33,368
if I wasn't in it.

803
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:35,704
Everybody that I consider family...

804
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,081
...I've ruined their lives, man.

805
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:42,840
No, you didn't.

806
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:46,616
Nobody made us do anything...

807
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:51,928
...you, least of all.

808
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:55,672
What we did was on us.

809
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,145
And, hey,

810
00:38:57,242 --> 00:39:00,728
we're still family, okay?

811
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:06,328
That's my ride.

812
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,976
I got to go.

813
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,016
If you get the chance, um...

814
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:20,056
tell Perez I'm sorry.

815
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,688
Yeah, all right.

816
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,168
You're my boy, Nico.

817
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,600
As far as I'm concerned,

818
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:35,064
we're square.

819
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:37,240
Man, come here.

820
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,928
Oh, man, I'm gonna miss you, bro.

821
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,009
- Okay?
- Yeah.

822
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:47,512
Hey.

823
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,728
Be safe.

824
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,520
You know me.

825
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:09,624
There she is, lady of the hour.

826
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,064
Champagne, my man.

827
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:12,312
What are we celebrating?

828
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,968
Oh, I have secured
a little piece of business

829
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:18,968
that's gonna allow us to
consummate our new relationship.

830
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,907
Oh, buy a girl dinner first.

831
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,102
Wow. A woman with standards,

832
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:24,430
which no doubt tells me

833
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:27,736
your demonstration will be impressive.

834
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,272
Oh, well...

835
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,681
Here you are.

836
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:31,928
Thank you.

837
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:34,808
Well, welcome...

838
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:36,984
to Casino Duvall.

839
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:38,424
All right.

840
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:41,016
Look at that.

841
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:43,224
I like it so far.

842
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,400
I generated a back door
into a functioning

843
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,576
online poker game via the dark web.

844
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:50,585
Around this table are several accounts

845
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,992
using various identities,

846
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,096
all of which have one thing
in common... they're all me.

847
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:56,632
I stake myself using your funds,

848
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,696
I lose several hands
to each player, then I cash out.

849
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:05,272
But remember, I win,
because... I'm everybody.

850
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,488
Everyone. Right.

851
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:09,880
Fees are minimal,
all the accounts are offshore,

852
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:13,848
and the money that reaches
your account is pristine.

853
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:15,864
Smooth.

854
00:41:15,962 --> 00:41:18,681
So, tell me, how do I check

855
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:19,993
the status of my funds?

856
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,040
Oh.

857
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,992
The program is right here.

858
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,753
You can upload that
to any computer you like,

859
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,312
or Jodee is playing in real-time.

860
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,488
You can log on
and monitor our every move

861
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:33,016
whenever you like.

862
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:35,128
Nice.

863
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,432
Very cool.

864
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,440
What happened to consummation?

865
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,648
Oh, well, you can't begrudge me

866
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,528
a little prophylactic protection,

867
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:51,128
not in this day and age.

868
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:53,688
Just as soon as my little techie docs

869
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:57,528
get finished checking
the stick you gave me,

870
00:41:57,626 --> 00:42:00,344
I'll put it in any port
you damn well desire.

871
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,056
Oh, Nina.

872
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,448
Just remember... that one is loaded.

873
00:42:15,162 --> 00:42:16,440
It's clean.

874
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:18,520
And there it is.

875
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:20,088
Whip it out and stick it in.

876
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:22,104
The money will be wired in 10 days.

877
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,736
But before you go,

878
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,264
I got a question for you.

879
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:29,400
Does the name Gabriel Knox
mean anything to you?

880
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,152
Hey.

881
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,912
Hey.

882
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:54,744
How you holding up?

883
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,984
I met a woman

884
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:00,408
who seemed to have a perfect life...

885
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:03,960
I mean, husband she loved,

886
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:06,232
beautiful children,

887
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,208
really nice house.

888
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,288
But...

889
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:13,976
She couldn't escape

890
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:17,176
her criminal past.

891
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:21,400
Who's to say it won't be me someday?

892
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,224
I don't know.

893
00:43:23,322 --> 00:43:25,752
Me?

894
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,840
Too corny.

895
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,376
Yeah.

896
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:30,136
So corny.

897
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:35,256
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:35,354 --> 00:43:37,240
Me, too.

899
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:46,584
You hungry?

900
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:49,528
Oh, I'm starving.

901
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,032
You cooking?

902
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,312
No, not me.

903
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,360
Izzy.

904
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:55,864
Hey, Iz.

905
00:43:57,786 --> 00:43:59,832
She made a friend today.

906
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,936
I invited him. I hope you don't mind.

907
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:04,056
Where would you like these?

908
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:05,816
I got you.

909
00:44:09,434 --> 00:44:11,160
You two talk.

910
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,376
I mean, what... how did, uh...

911
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:19,224
Izzy. You know, she asked me

912
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:22,072
why we weren't close, and, uh,

913
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,792
I didn't know what to say.

914
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,616
I mean, do you want to sit down, or...?

915
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,312
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:44:32,058 --> 00:44:35,352
You know, she's, uh,
she's the first person

917
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,912
to ever ask me that question directly.

918
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,872
I realized...

919
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,952
you know, after everything
that happened,

920
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,672
you were the one that answered
all the questions,

921
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,464
filtered all the calls,

922
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,832
dealt with the neighbors.

923
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,655
I mean, you did this for 20 years.

924
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:57,272
What choice did we have?
You were only 12, you know?

925
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:02,168
I just wish we had a do-over.

926
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:05,272
I've let you protect me
for far too long...

927
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,248
my whole life.

928
00:45:08,346 --> 00:45:09,944
Now it's my turn to protect you.

929
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:15,704
I'm gonna tell the police
what happened, what I did.

930
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:17,656
You don't have to do that.

931
00:45:17,754 --> 00:45:20,984
Nancy, it's time.

932
00:45:21,082 --> 00:45:23,352
I have to do this.

933
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,984
I want to do this.

934
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:32,216
Okay.

935
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:36,248
Hey, Lieutenant.

936
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:47,416
I'm here to confess to killing
Rosa Perez...

937
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:49,336
Our mom.

938
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,807
Hey.

939
00:45:54,906 --> 00:45:58,040
Buy me a drink.

940
00:45:58,138 --> 00:45:59,576
- Come on!
- I get it. Nah, I get it.

941
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,264
I know what's going on.

942
00:46:02,362 --> 00:46:04,529
- What?
- Syd, you're ending things.

943
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:05,592
Oh, my God.

944
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,128
You always like to deliver
bad news in public

945
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:10,840
to avoid a scene,
but I'll save you the trouble.

946
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,848
Look, I'm sorry if I came off too pushy.

947
00:46:13,946 --> 00:46:15,736
I know that I can do that sometimes.

948
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:18,680
But in my defense,
I went for the Styrofoam Cup.

949
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,952
- You're the one who gave me the mug.
- Shh, shh, shh.

950
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,032
Come on.

951
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:30,488
Warren, you remember my father, Joseph.

952
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:31,800
Good to see you again, sir.

953
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,200
Yeah, good to see you.
Better circumstances this time.

954
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:35,256
Is Fletch in?

955
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,984
No, he stepped out.

956
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:38,648
There you go.

957
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:52,376
- What's all this?
- I've done it.

958
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:56,216
I planted software
in Bishop Duvall's computer.

959
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,432
It gave us complete access

960
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,775
to all of his financial information,

961
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:01,400
and I got confirmation that Gabriel Knox

962
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:04,791
is buying his supply
of fentanyl in 10 days.

963
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,063
We're gonna take him down.

964
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:23,096
Wait. I know you don't like
being kept in the dark.

965
00:47:23,194 --> 00:47:26,040
That's why I brought you here.

966
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,728
I want to let you in.

967
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:31,256
Things are not gonna go

968
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:32,792
the way you want them to go.

969
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:34,551
What do you mean?

970
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:35,992
We're almost to the end.

971
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,552
We're gonna nail Gabriel Knox.

972
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,344
No, listen, listen.

973
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:43,224
Listen.

974
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:47,192
Everything you think you know, Syd...

975
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:50,775
everything is wrong, okay?

976
00:47:50,873 --> 00:47:52,791
What are you talking about?

977
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,872
Warren, what are you talking about?

978
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:21,495
I am...

979
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:23,736
Gabriel Knox.
